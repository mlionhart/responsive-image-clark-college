            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Clark College inspires learners to excel, transforms lives, and strengthens our increasingly diverse community.</p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>Clark College, in service to the community, guides individuals to achieve their educational and professional goals.</p>
            <h2>History and Traditions</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1933, Clark College is the oldest institution of higher education in Southwest Washington. Founded as a private, two-year, junior college, Clark College received its first accreditation in 1937 and has been accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities since 1948. It was incorporated into the statewide community college system in 1967. Clark has developed a rich history and relationship with both its own community and the community around it. Many of its annual events, like its Jazz Fest and Sakura Festival, are traditions that go back years or even decades.</p>
            <h2>College Theme: Transformation</h2>
            <p>A college theme represents a common idea that the entire college, and the community that we serve, can gather around. Clark College’s Strategic Plan is founded on the core principle of the learning college: the work undertaken by each and every member of the college community shares the common outcome of student learning. In alignment with this, the college theme will be integrated across a broad sweep of college services. </p>
